Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction, if they are similar in quality return Tie. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.

Here are some rules of the evaluation:
(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better. You should be sure to assign ties when the responses are similar in quality.

Do NOT provide any explanation for your choice.
Do NOT say both / neither are good.

# Question:
{instruction}

# Output (a):
{output_1}

# Output (b):
{output_2}

### Instruction: Which is better, Output (a), Output (b) or is it a Tie? Answer using ONLY "Output (a)", "Output (b)" or "Tie". Do NOT output any other words or symbols.
